# Task 1: Software configuration.
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Date IT Challenge?
    
Hi!
My name is Filip, and I'm a would-be PhD student in Food Science and Human Nutrition.
I have always been good with computers, solving problems, etc. so I choose to change something and start a new career.

From not so recent period of time I stared doing some courses in Manual Testing to get into IT word
and gain new skill, mainly to get a useful job. :sweat_smile: I had a small break doing it, but now
I'm back with new energy and motivation!

I thought that learning even the basics of test automatization would help me to get a first job as QA.
It also looks good on CV :grin:
